Felix Fox was on his daily afternoon stroll, when he saw a large group of animals collected around something. Curious to see what was happening, Felix Fox pushed through the crowd until he was at the center. What he saw was so horrifying, he couldn’t even speak. The Squilly squirrel family was standing with tiny suitcases in their furry arms looking at what used to be their home. In front of them lay a tree stump. Sanjay Squirrel was carving a heart into the stump with a twig, while crying.
 
“Wah wah wah boo hoo boo hoo”

Mama squirrel was struggling to stay strong. She looked around at her neighbors: Harvey the Hedgehog, the Forest Hills ant colony, Rafael the Racoon, Felix Fox, Cheng the Chipmunk, Juan the Anteater, and many more. 

“Please help my babies and I, we are homeless! Please, we will give you a good share of acorns. Someone has cut down the home that my babies grew up in. We have lost almost everything”, Mama squirrel exclaimed in her southern accent. 

One by one, they all made excuses and made their way back home.

“My wife, Juanita, is pregnant with our baby, Juanito. We can’t take anyone else right now. Sorry my friend, good luck!” said Juan the Anteater.

“No offense, but if you move in with us, you will trample our population” said the queen ant of the Forest Hills ant colony. 

“Hmph, when our family was going through a rough time finding trash to eat, you didn’t give us any acorns. Why should I help you now?”, Rafael the Racoon said angrily before stomping away with his family.

“Sorry… but our kinds don’t really get along very well.” said Cheng the Chipmunk.
Looking around, Mama Squirrel lost all hope, as she could see that there was only one neighbor left. Felix Fox. 

Felix Fox nervously said, “Well Mama Squirrel, my family would be happy to take you in during this time of need.”

Mama squirrel thought for a moment. She had heard that foxes in general were sly creatures. Of course, she had never had any problems with this fox family when they had interacted with each other from afar, but she still was a little suspicious. However, her hands were tied so she reluctantly accepted his offer.

Little did she know that they would soon become great friends with each other’s families.

 <h3 id="list-item-8">Our Home is Changing</h4>
  
      <p style="font-size:20px">
      Long ago, before Felix Fox and his family lived in Forest Hills, Felix’s great-grandpa Francis was the first of the Fox Family to arrive in Animal Land. They had moved from Creature Island hoping for a better life and more food to store for the family. 
      <p style="font-size:20px">
“Get out, you sneaky foxes! Who do you think will hire predators like you!”
          </p> 
      <p style="font-size:20px">
“Sorry, but we just can’t rent the burrow to you guys. Who knows if you’ll do bad stuff here?”
          </p> 
    <p style="font-size:20px">
You see, back then, it was hard for predator families like the Foxes and the Bears to find homes because everyone was so scared of them!
         </p> 
    <p style="font-size:20px">
So, they all had to live in Creature Island, where it was safe for them to find food and build burrows for their homes. 
But predators are big animals, and slowly food was beginning to run out for the families that lived there.
        </p> 
    
    <p style="font-size:20px">
Some of the animals, like Francis Fox and his family, decided to travel to other lands in order to live better lives. They hoped and hoped and hoped that wherever they ended up going would be a good place full of yummy food for everyone!
But sadly, not everyone was okay with all these new predators moving into their neighborhoods. 
        </p> 
    <p style="font-size:20px">
It became super hard for Francis and his family to find jobs, rent a burrow, and do lots of things that seemed super easy for everyone else in Forest Hills.
And so, the Fox family lived very poorly for many years. 
        </p> 
    <p style="font-size:20px">
To make up for their sad life, Francis told his kids wonderful stories every night to make them happy.
However, one thing that Francis always made sure to tell his children before he finished was:
        </p> 
    <p style="font-size:20px">
“Remember mis hijos. Be nice to all the other animals that you come across. Always make sure to say ‘Good Morning!’ or ‘Good Afternoon!’ when you pass by adults and be respectful to everyone!”
        </p> 
     <p style="font-size:20px">
“Why Papa? Why do we have to be so nice to all the animals even when they look at us funny and act mean to us?” asked his children.
           </p> 
    <p style="font-size:20px">
“If we show everyone that we are good, nice people through our actions, then they will begin to accept us as part of their community” Francis replied, “ Little by little they will accept us, I just know it”
         </p> 
    <p style="font-size:20px">
And it turns out that many years later, Francis would be correct in all the lessons he taught his children. 
        </p>
    <p style="font-size:20px">
Through lots of hard work, animals began to realize that predators weren’t all that bad, and they began to live together peacefully. Finally Francis’ dream had come true!
