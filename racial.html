Long ago, before Felix Fox and his family lived in Forest Hills, Felix’s great-grandpa Francis was the first of the Fox Family to arrive in Animal Land. They had moved from Creature Island hoping for a better life and more food to store for the family. 
“Get out, you sneaky foxes! Who do you think will hire predators like you!”
“Sorry, but we just can’t rent the burrow to you guys. Who knows if you’ll do bad stuff here?”
You see, back then, it was hard for predator families like the Foxes and the Bears to find homes because everyone was so scared of them!
So, they all had to live in Creature Island, where it was safe for them to find food and build burrows for their homes. 
But predators are big animals, and slowly food was beginning to run out for the families that lived there.
Some of the animals, like Francis Fox and his family, decided to travel to other lands in order to live better lives. They hoped and hoped and hoped that wherever they ended up going would be a good place full of yummy food for everyone!
But sadly, not everyone was okay with all these new predators moving into their neighborhoods. 
It became super hard for Francis and his family to find jobs, rent a burrow, and do lots of things that seemed super easy for everyone else in Forest Hills.
And so, the Fox family lived very poorly for many years. To make up for their sad life, Francis told his kids wonderful stories every night to make them happy.
However, one thing that Francis always made sure to tell his children before he finished was:
“Remember mis hijos. Be nice to all the other animals that you come across. Always make sure to say ‘Good Morning!’ or ‘Good Afternoon!’ when you pass by adults and be respectful to everyone!”
“Why Papa? Why do we have to be so nice to all the animals even when they look at us funny and act mean to us?” asked his children.
“If we show everyone that we are good, nice people through our actions, then they will begin to accept us as part of their community” Francis replied, “ Little by little they will accept us, I just know it”
And it turns out that many years later, Francis would be correct in all the lessons he taught his children. 
Through lots of hard work, animals began to realize that predators weren’t all that bad, and they began to live together peacefully. Finally Francis’ dream had come true!
