Felix Fox was walking through the woods one day to meet up with his friend Gary Grasshopper.
The two had made plans to play together all fall before winter could come, and Felix was super excited to get started! With his toys in hand, Felix skipped all the way to Gary’s house.
Knock Knock
“Who’s there?” cried Gary from behind the door.
“It’s me, silly! How could you forget our playdate?” Felix happily replied, “It’s only been halfway through the fall, we need to keep going!”
“O-oh”, said Gary. “Um, actually I was going to talk to you about that Felix.”
“I’ve been talking with my friend Anthony Ant, and he thinks I should start helping my mom pack for winter early this year, so that we’re ready ahead of time.”
Felix’s tail sank to the ground, and his ears flopped.
“Hmm? So does that mean that we can’t play anymore” said Felix sadly.
“No, no! I still want to play with you! I just think that I need to finish storing all this food first, and then we can play later. Sorry, Felix :( ”
“It’s okay, Gary. See you later then” Felix murmured.
And so, Felix Fox began his long walk back home through Forest Hills, his toys sadly following behind him. 
Once he got home, Felix plopped down onto his bed and sighed. 
He was so sad that he couldn’t play with his friend anymore, and stayed there lying down for the rest of the day.
Once it was dinnertime, Felix’s mom walked into his room, looking for her son.
“What’s wrong honey?” she said, while rubbing his back in circles.
“I can’t play with Gary anymore, Mom. We were going to play the whole fall together, and now our whole plan is ruined!” Felix cried into his mom’s arm.
“Why can’t you play with him anymore mijo? Did something happen between you two?” 
“No, he has to prepare for winter early this year with his parents. Thats so dumb, why can’t we just play forever like we promised?” Felix cried.
 “Aw honey, Gary is just trying to be a big helper for his parents so that they don’t have to work as hard while preparing for winter. You can’t play forever mijo, because everyone needs to help out sooner or later” 
“Really? That sucks” pouted Felix
Laughing, Felicity Fox poked her son in the cheek and said “Well, let's think about it like this.  If you go help Gary and his family, then they can finish earlier, and you guys can play again!”
“Really mom?”
“Yes my Felix, now let’s go eat dinner so that you can call the Grasshopper family and ask if it would be okay for you to come help them tomorrow”
“Okay!”
