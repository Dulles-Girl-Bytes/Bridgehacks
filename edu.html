     <p style="font-size:20px">
Felix Fox was walking through the woods one day to meet up with his friend Gary Grasshopper.
The two had made plans to play together all fall before winter could come, and Felix was super excited to get started! With his toys in hand, Felix skipped all the way to Gary’s house.

<br>
         *Knock Knock*

<br>
         <img src="bucketfox.png" width = "400" height = "300" class="center">

<br>
“Who’s there?” cried Gary from behind the door.
    
        <br>
“It’s me, silly! How could you forget our playdate?” Felix happily replied, “It’s only been halfway through the fall, we need to keep going!”
            
        <br>
“O-oh”, said Gary. “Um, actually I was going to talk to you about that Felix. I’ve been talking with my friend Anthony Ant, and he thinks I should start helping my mom pack for winter early this year, so that we’re ready ahead of time.”
             
        
       
Felix’s tail sank to the ground, and his ears flopped.
“Hmm? So does that mean that we can’t play anymore” said Felix sadly.
           
       <br>
“No, no! I still want to play with you! I just think that I need to finish storing all this food first, and then we can play later. Sorry, Felix :( ”
           
        <br>
“It’s okay, Gary. See you later then” Felix murmured.
            
        <br>
And so, Felix Fox began his long walk back home through Forest Hills, his toys sadly following behind him. 
Once he got home, Felix plopped down onto his bed and sighed. 
He was so sad that he couldn’t play with his friend anymore, and stayed there lying down for the rest of the day.
            
        <br>
Once it was dinnertime, Felix’s mom walked into his room, looking for her son.
            
        <br>
“What’s wrong honey?” she said, while rubbing his back in circles.
          
        <br>
“I can’t play with Gary anymore, Mom. We were going to play the whole fall together, and now our whole plan is ruined!” Felix cried into his mom’s arm.
          
      <br>
“Why can’t you play with him anymore mijo? Did something happen between you two?” 
           
        <br>
“No, he has to prepare for winter early this year with his parents. Thats so dumb, why can’t we just play forever like we promised?” Felix cried.
            
        <br>
 “Aw honey, Gary is just trying to be a big helper for his parents so that they don’t have to work as hard while preparing for winter. You can’t play forever mijo, because everyone needs to help out sooner or later” 
            
        <br>
“Really? That sucks” pouted Felix
             
      <br>
Laughing, Felicity Fox poked her son in the cheek and said “Well, let's think about it like this.  If you go help Gary and his family, then they can finish earlier, and you guys can play again!”
            
        <br>
“Really mom?”
            
       <br>
“Yes my Felix, now let’s go eat dinner so that you can call the Grasshopper family and ask if it would be okay for you to come help them tomorrow”
            
         <br>
“Okay!”

        <h3 id="list-item-8">Family History</h4>
  
      <p style="font-size:20px">
      Long ago, before Felix Fox and his family lived in Forest Hills, Felix’s great-grandpa Francis was the first of the Fox Family to arrive in Animal Land. They had moved from Creature Island hoping for a better life and more food to store for the family. 
      <p style="font-size:20px">
“Get out, you sneaky foxes! Who do you think will hire predators like you!”
          </p> 
      <p style="font-size:20px">
“Sorry, but we just can’t rent the burrow to you guys. Who knows if you’ll do bad stuff here?”
          </p> 
    <p style="font-size:20px">
You see, back then, it was hard for predator families like the Foxes and the Bears to find homes because everyone was so scared of them!
         </p> 
    <p style="font-size:20px">
So, they all had to live in Creature Island, where it was safe for them to find food and build burrows for their homes. 
But predators are big animals, and slowly food was beginning to run out for the families that lived there.
        </p> 
    
    <p style="font-size:20px">
Some of the animals, like Francis Fox and his family, decided to travel to other lands in order to live better lives. They hoped and hoped and hoped that wherever they ended up going would be a good place full of yummy food for everyone!
But sadly, not everyone was okay with all these new predators moving into their neighborhoods. 
        </p> 
    <p style="font-size:20px">
It became super hard for Francis and his family to find jobs, rent a burrow, and do lots of things that seemed super easy for everyone else in Forest Hills.
And so, the Fox family lived very poorly for many years. 
        </p> 
    <p style="font-size:20px">
To make up for their sad life, Francis told his kids wonderful stories every night to make them happy.
However, one thing that Francis always made sure to tell his children before he finished was:
        </p> 
    <p style="font-size:20px">
“Remember mis hijos. Be nice to all the other animals that you come across. Always make sure to say ‘Good Morning!’ or ‘Good Afternoon!’ when you pass by adults and be respectful to everyone!”
        </p> 
     <p style="font-size:20px">
“Why Papa? Why do we have to be so nice to all the animals even when they look at us funny and act mean to us?” asked his children.
           </p> 
    <p style="font-size:20px">
“If we show everyone that we are good, nice people through our actions, then they will begin to accept us as part of their community” Francis replied, “ Little by little they will accept us, I just know it”
         </p> 
    <p style="font-size:20px">
And it turns out that many years later, Francis would be correct in all the lessons he taught his children. 
        </p>
    <p style="font-size:20px">
Through lots of hard work, animals began to realize that predators weren’t all that bad, and they began to live together peacefully. Finally Francis’ dream had come true!
