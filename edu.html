Felix Fox was walking through the woods one day to meet up with his friend Gary Grasshopper.
The two had made plans to play together all fall before winter could come, and Felix was super excited to get started! With his toys in hand, Felix skipped all the way to Gary’s house.

 <br><br>
         *Knock Knock*

 <br><br>
         <img src="bucketfox.png" width = "400" height = "300" class="center">

 <br><br>
“Who’s there?” cried Gary from behind the door.
    
        <br><br>
“It’s me, silly! How could you forget our playdate?” Felix happily replied, “It’s only been halfway through the fall, we need to keep going!”
            
         <br><br>
“O-oh”, said Gary. “Um, actually I was going to talk to you about that Felix. I’ve been talking with my friend Anthony Ant, and he thinks I should start helping my mom pack for winter early this year, so that we’re ready ahead of time.”
             
        
        <br><br>
Felix’s tail sank to the ground, and his ears flopped.
“Hmm? So does that mean that we can’t play anymore” said Felix sadly.
           
       <br><br>
“No, no! I still want to play with you! I just think that I need to finish storing all this food first, and then we can play later. Sorry, Felix :( ”
           
         <br><br>
“It’s okay, Gary. See you later then” Felix murmured.
            
         <br><br>
And so, Felix Fox began his long walk back home through Forest Hills, his toys sadly following behind him. 
Once he got home, Felix plopped down onto his bed and sighed. 
He was so sad that he couldn’t play with his friend anymore, and stayed there lying down for the rest of the day.
            
         <br><br>
Once it was dinnertime, Felix’s mom walked into his room, looking for her son.
            
        <br><br>
“What’s wrong honey?” she said, while rubbing his back in circles.
          
         <br><br>
“I can’t play with Gary anymore, Mom. We were going to play the whole fall together, and now our whole plan is ruined!” Felix cried into his mom’s arm.
          
       <br><br>
“Why can’t you play with him anymore mijo? Did something happen between you two?” 
           
         <br><br>
“No, he has to prepare for winter early this year with his parents. Thats so dumb, why can’t we just play forever like we promised?” Felix cried.
            
       <br><br>
 “Aw honey, Gary is just trying to be a big helper for his parents so that they don’t have to work as hard while preparing for winter. You can’t play forever mijo, because everyone needs to help out sooner or later” 
            
       <br><br>
“Really? That sucks” pouted Felix
             
     <br><br>
Laughing, Felicity Fox poked her son in the cheek and said “Well, let's think about it like this.  If you go help Gary and his family, then they can finish earlier, and you guys can play again!”
            
         <br><br>
“Really mom?”
            
       <br><br>
“Yes my Felix, now let’s go eat dinner so that you can call the Grasshopper family and ask if it would be okay for you to come help them tomorrow”
            
          <br><br>
“Okay!”

        <h3 id="list-item-8"> A New Pair of Shoes</h4>
  
      <p style="font-size:20px">
    While Felix Fox was walking in the street in Forest Hills, he spotted his little brother, Felipe Fox, walking with his friend, Frank. The two of them had just come back from the store, when Felipe was seemingly annoyed at Frank.
          <br><br>

“I wanted us to have matching shoes!”, Felipe exclaimed at Frank. “You got those stupid red ones instead! I told you I wanted the blue ones for both of us!”
           <br><br>

“But Felipe, I really liked the red one. Why can’t I like other things?” Frank responded.
           <br><br>
“Dude, everyone’s gonna make fun of you in school. Those are so weird.” 
           <br><br>

“But I like those- why can’t they leave me alone?”
           <br><br>

“It’s not cool. Whatever, I guess you’ll have to see what people say at school.”
           <br><br>

Days went by and Frank faced bullying by many students. He felt discriminated against by his peers for not wearing the “cool” or “normal” shoes.
           <br><br>

“Hey Felipe, I know you said my shoes aren’t cool, but why does everyone have to make fun of me for it? I'm just a kid, the only difference is my shoes!”
 <br><br>
“Frank, I honestly don't know. It wasn't right of me to make fun of you, and I didnt mean to hurt your feelings. I accept your differences and who you are, and something minor like your shoes shouldn’t affect my perception of you. I’ll try to make the whole class understand.”
 <br><br>
Although Felipe understood the differences between the two, many people are quick to criticize and judge others because of their differences. We are all human, and should be treated equally and fairly. While Frank still faces hatred because of his preferences, we must understand that this isn't right  and Frank did nothing wrong. We are human, and should be treated as such.
          others differently based on their tastes. They are still human and deserve to be treated like everyone else. People should be judged on their actions, and how kind they treat others.</i>
