  <p>Felix Fox was on his daily afternoon stroll, when he saw a large group of animals collected around something. Curious to see what was happening, Felix Fox pushed through the crowd until he was at the center. What he saw was so horrifying, he couldn’t even speak. The Squilly squirrel family was standing with tiny suitcases in their furry arms looking at what used to be their home. In front of them lay a tree stump. Sanjay Squirrel was carving a heart into the stump with a twig, while crying.
 
“Wah wah wah boo hoo boo hoo”

Mama squirrel was struggling to stay strong. She looked around at her neighbors: Harvey the Hedgehog, the Forest Hills ant colony, Rafael the Racoon, Felix Fox, Cheng the Chipmunk, Juan the Anteater, and many more. 

“Please help my babies and I, we are homeless! Please, we will give you a good share of acorns. Someone has cut down the home that my babies grew up in. We have lost almost everything”, Mama squirrel exclaimed in her southern accent. 

One by one, they all made excuses and made their way back home.

“My wife, Juanita, is pregnant with our baby, Juanito. We can’t take anyone else right now. Sorry my friend, good luck!” said Juan the Anteater.

“No offense, but if you move in with us, you will trample our population” said the queen ant of the Forest Hills ant colony. 

“Hmph, when our family was going through a rough time finding trash to eat, you didn’t give us any acorns. Why should I help you now?”, Rafael the Racoon said angrily before stomping away with his family.

“Sorry… but our kinds don’t really get along very well.” said Cheng the Chipmunk.
Looking around, Mama Squirrel lost all hope, as she could see that there was only one neighbor left. Felix Fox. 

Felix Fox nervously said, “Well Mama Squirrel, my family would be happy to take you in during this time of need.”

Mama squirrel thought for a moment. She had heard that foxes in general were sly creatures. Of course, she had never had any problems with this fox family when they had interacted with each other from afar, but she still was a little suspicious. However, her hands were tied so she reluctantly accepted his offer.

Little did she know that they would soon become great friends with each other’s families.

  <h4 id="list-item-2">Eating Healthy</h4>
  <p>It was an ordinary day for Felix Fox as he made his way to his home. He heard his stomach grumble, realizing that it was hungry.

“Mom! Where’s the food?” he asked out loud.
To his surprise, Felicity Fox responded in a harsh tone, “Go get some yourself!”

Felix jumped in shock to hear his mom angry. He left the house, scared to communicate with her. Felix takes on the journey to get his food through the jungle, looking for anything that looks appealing. As he walks, he finds a cake covered in sugar and instantly reaches for it. 

Suddenly, his dad’s voice comes into his mind “don't eat any sugar! Itll cause you to become sick! You're young, you need healthy food to become a big and strong fox!”. He disregards it, convincing himself it was just a myth and that he would be just fine with the cake. As he bit it, his face began to turn purple and he found himself sick to the stomach. 

“Help! Help!” He cried out, hoping for someone to hear him. He began to have a stomachache.

Suddenly his friend, Gary Grasshopper flew over him. Seeing him in this state, he panicked, unaware of what happened and what to do. He frantically looked around, searching for a clue as to what happened. He saw the cake and knew. 

“Felix Fox! Don't worry, I'm here. I know what happened and how to stop it!”. Gary said and instantly went to work. He began to look for a counterpart to the cake, something healthy that would stop the sugary sweet. 

He saw a fresh piece of strawberry and knew that was it. He ran to it and took it, feeding it to Felix Fox. Instantly Felix stood up, his stomach still and face returned to normal.

“Thank you so muc Gary! I don't know what i would have done without you!”
“Of course Felix. That's what friends do! And also, please, next time, don't eat the cake!”
“Yeah, I knew i shouldnt. I heard an inner voice tell me not too, but I still did. I shouldn't have though”
“At Least you're fine now Felix. You're lucky I was walking through this forest!”

Eating healthy, importance of friendship, listening to your inner conscious
