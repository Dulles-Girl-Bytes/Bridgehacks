<p style="font-size:20px;font-family:'Montserrat'">
It was an ordinary day for Felix Fox as he made his way to his home. He heard his stomach grumble, realizing that it was hungry.

<p style="font-size:20px">
“Mom! Where’s the food?” he asked out loud.
To his surprise, Felicity Fox responded in a harsh tone, “Go get some yourself!”
</p>
<br>
<p style="font-size:20px"><i>
Felix jumped in shock to hear his mom angry. He left the house, scared to communicate with her. Felix takes on the journey to get his food through the jungle, looking for anything that looked appealing. As he walked, he found a cake covered in sugar and instantly reached for it.

        <p style="font-size:20px">
         <img src=" cake+felix.jpg" width = "400" height = "300" class="center">
            <br>
</p>

        <p style="font-size:20px">
Suddenly, his dad’s voice came into his mind “Don't eat any sugar! It'll cause you to become sick! You're young, you need healthy food to become a big and strong fox!”. He disregarded it, convincing himself it was just a myth and that he would be just fine with the cake. As he bit it, his face began to turn purple and he found himself sick to the stomach. 
            </p>
        <p style="font-size:20px">
“Help! Help!” He cried out, hoping for someone to hear him. He began to have a stomachache.
             </p>
        <p style="font-size:20px">
Suddenly his friend, Gary Grasshopper flew over him. Seeing him in this state, he panicked, unaware of what happened and what to do. He frantically looked around, searching for a clue as to what happened. He saw the cake and knew. 

            </p>
        <p style="font-size:20px">
“Felix Fox! Don't worry, I'm here. I know what happened and how to stop it!”. Gary said and instantly went to work. He began to look for a counterpart to the cake, something healthy that would stop the sugary sweet. 
            </p>
        <p style="font-size:20px">
He saw a fresh piece of strawberry and knew that was it. He ran to it and took it, feeding it to Felix Fox. Instantly Felix stood up, his stomach still and face returned to normal.
            </p>
        <p style="font-size:20px">
“Thank you so much Gary! I don't know what I would have done without you!”
            </p>
        <p style="font-size:20px">
“Of course Felix. That's what friends do! And also, please, next time, don't eat the cake!”

             </p>
        <p style="font-size:20px">
“Yeah, I knew I shouldn't have. I heard an inner voice tell me not too, but I still did. I shouldn't have though”
            </p>
        <p style="font-size:20px">
“At Least you're fine now Felix. You're lucky I was walking through this forest!”
            </p>

         <h4 id="list-item-6">Working Together to End an Illness</h4>

<p style="font-size:20px">
Felix Fox was on his afternoon stroll, walking through the forest to go to his friend, Pally Python’s house. They were to meet up with 4 other friends and work on a project focussed on a deadly virus, CAVED-20. 
<p style="font-size:20px">
Suddenly, he heard an announcement from Emily Eagle, “Everyone! Please make sure to cover your face with a mask! We don't want to spread any illnesses!”
</p>
<br>
<p style="font-size:20px">
So, Felix ran back to his house to get a covering. On his way to Pally’s house, he saw many other families walking around, without a covering. He shivered at the sight of it, thinking that without the covering, the illness would spread even faster.     </p>
        <p style="font-size:20px">
         <img src="Untitled design (3).png" width = "400" height = "300" class="center">
            <br>
</p>

        <p style="font-size:20px">
As he went to Pally’s house,his other friends joined him, each wearing a covering. They entered Pally’s house, ready to work on their project on informing others about the illness.             </p>
        <p style="font-size:20px">             </p>
        <p style="font-size:20px">
They all worked together, and stayed safe, researching on how to stop the illness from spreading. As they researched they found the best way to stay safe was to wear a covering. They worked together to create posters and get the word out that everyone should wear a covering. 
            </p>
        <p style="font-size:20px">
When he left Pally’s house, he was relieved to see their posters and publicity had worked, and all the families he had seen without a mask were now covered and wearing a mask.
